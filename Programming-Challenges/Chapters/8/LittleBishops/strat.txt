The thing is that this problem is so large that it ALWAYS will give you TLE (Time Limit Exceeded).

So (it may seem like cheating, but according to the teacher, its not),
the solution is to precompute the solution for every possible combination on your own
(and make the program output a string with code for making a dict, so that you only have to copy-paste)
and just make the actual program get the solution from the dict depending on the combination given by input.

Pre-computing program ---> res_dict = {(1,1) = 1, ...} ---> print(res_dict[n, k]) (after getting n,k from input)
